You might know the website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://rottentomatoes.com) it is a site where people can review movies. In this tutorial you are going to build Rotten Potatoes - your very own movie review website.

By finishing this tutorial you will continue to deepen your knowledge of Node.js and Express.js as well as master the internet-wide paradigms of RESTful and Resourceful routing. You will be Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting (CRUD) a single `Review` resource. You will also learn how to use a MongoDB document-based database with Express.js.

Before we get started, let's make a plan for what **User Stories** we're going to build. Then we'll jump in and **bootstrap**—begin—our Express.js app and add a templating engine.

# User Stories

Software development these days is usually organized into **Agile Sprints** that are usually two weeks long. You'll notice evidence of this if you ever update your apps and read the update text. Sometimes it just says:

```
We ship a new version every two weeks...
```

That's because they are organizing their engineering in this standard agile way.

During each sprint developers pick a few **User Stories** to build, test, and ship to production. A **User Story** is one chunk of functionality. Engineers use the term **User Story** instead of "feature" to emphasize the user's experience in their design, development and testing. This emphasis on the user is called **User Centered Development**. Whenever you build anything on a team or by yourself, always use a **Backlog** of **User Stories** to organize and prioritize what you will build and when.

It is a good habit to build applications one resource at a time, adding all the **Resourceful Routes** for each resource before moving to the next.

So the user stories we can have for this review app will be as follows:

1. Users can view all reviews (index)
1. Users can create a review (new/create)
1. Users can view one review (show)
1. Users can delete a review (destroy)
1. Users can edit a review (edit/update)

Once we have this single `Review` resource build, we can move onto making an associated `Comment` resource.

1. Users can comment on reviews (comments#create)
1. Users can delete comments (comments#destroy)

As we finish and test user stories we'll be committing to github :octopus:.

# Getting Started - Node.JS and `npm`

Now that we have some user stories, let's bootstrap an Express.js project so we can start on the first user story in the next chapter of this tutorial.

We're gonna jump right in to starting the new review and provide more context as new topics and concepts come up.

For reference for the rest of this chapter you can look at [ExpressJS's Getting Started](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) docs

Open your computer's terminal and then...

# Install Homebrew

If you don't already have Homebrew installed, install that first and then NodeJS & npm.

```bash
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ brew install node
```

> [info]
> Whenever you see the `$` in a command, that means it should be called in your computer's terminal. Remember: Don't include the `$` in your command.

# Starting a Node.js & Express.js Project

Use npm to initialize a Node review.

```bash
$ mkdir rotten-potatoes
$ cd rotten-potatoes
$ npm init
# (hit enter for each option it asks for to select the default choice)
```

With the commands above you made a new directory: 'rotten-potatoes', changed to that directory, and initialized a new npm project in that directory.

Now add Express.js and touch `app.js`

```
$ npm install express --save
$ touch app.js
```

Here you added express.js and created a new file named 'app.js'

Open 'app.js' in your favorite text editor. I recommend Atom. You can open your project in Atom by typing:

`$ atom .`

And let's add some standard Express.js code to `app.js`

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('App listening on port 3000!')
})
```

# Install nodemon and launch your server

Make sure you've installed `nodemon` and run your server by running nodemon.

```bash
$ npm install nodemon -g
$ nodemon app.js
```

You should see "Portfolio App listening on port 3000!" output in your terminal. And if you enter `localhost:3000` into your browser, you should see "Hello World".


# Add Handlebars.js as a Templating Engine

Now let's add our templating engine Handlebars.js so our Express.js server can render _server-side HTML templates_.

Install Handlebars.js to your review.

```bash
$ npm install express-handlebars --save
```

Initialize Handlebars.js in your app.

```js
// app.js
var exphbs = require('express-handlebars');

app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({defaultLayout: 'main'}));
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
```

Create the `views`, `layouts` folders and `main.handlebars` and `home.handlebars` files.

```bash
$ mkdir views
$ cd views
$ mkdir layouts
$ touch home.handlebars
$ cd layouts
$ touch main.handlebars
$ .. # to go back up a level
$ .. # to go back up one more level to the root folder of your review
```

Now extend your _root route_ to render `home.handlebars`.

```js
// app.js

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('home', { msg: 'Hello World!' });
})
```

```html
<!-- main.handlebars -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Rotten Potatoes</title>
</head>
<body>

  {{{body}}}

</body>
</html>
```

```html
<!-- home.handlebars -->
<h1>{{msg}}</h1>
```

Now when you visit `localhost:3000` you should still see "Hello World!" but now inside an `h1` tag.

# Initialize and Commit

Now that you have a bootstrapped project initialize and commit to github

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'init'
```

Now go to github and create a public repository called `Rotten-Potatoes-Tutorial`, and now associate it as a remote for your local git project and then push to it.

```bash
$ git remote add origin GITHUB-REPO-URL
$ git push origin master -u
```
